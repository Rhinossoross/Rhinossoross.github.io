                <h1> MASK MAKING</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            one of my longest running hobbies it that of making masks, i started when i was very young making masks and steampunk outfits for halloween;

                    This mask was created using stock parts, bronze paint and punk rivets. The eye sockets are fitted with recycled sunglasses lenses with LEDs soldured into a cheek switch. 
                    the hat is made from recycled a camping mat, and thin eva foam sheets, glued on using 2 part epoxy. this epoxy was used to create fake rivets around the panel edges.
                    all parts are painted in black, and then a bronze paint is rubed over to give the effect of dirty joints.

                    When I was a teenager I created masks for my favorate content creators, Technoblade, and CorpseHusband, both of these masks were created fully on tinkercad. a increadibly basic CAD program that only really allows Boolian operation on parts;
                    This cad file was then printed on my old anycubic cheron, and painted.

            <tr>
                <td >
                    The corpsehusband mask used a similar cheek operated light system as my first mask to power LEDs in the covered eye.
